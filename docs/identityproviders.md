# Identity Providers 

Auth0 is an "identity hub" that supports a number of authentication providers using different protocols: OAuth2, WS-Federation, etc. 

![](img/auth0-idp.png)

Auth0 sits in between your app and the system that authenticate your users. 

> The relationship between Auth0 and each of these authentication providers is called a 'connection'

Auth0 abstracts the handshake between the identity providers and your app, so you don't need to worry about their idiosyncracies and details (and nuances).

Auth0 is a multi-tenant service. When you register in Auth0 you get your own namespace (@@account.namespace@@). Many of these identity providers require registration and you will need to configure a `return url`. This will always be:

	https://@@account.namespace@@/login/callback

##Enterprise Identity Providers

### Google Apps
Google Apps uses OAuth2 and you have the option to request more advanced API access or user's attributes. In particular, you can query to which groups the user belongs to.

This is useful if your service is used by a company with users in Google Apps, and you want to drive authorization based on the group membership. You can write rules like: "anyone from __Marketing__ can read from my app", "anyone from __Sales__ can create new proposals", etc.

In this examples, membership to the _Sales_ and _Marketing_ groups is information kept in Google Apps, not your own app.

> This is a good thing, as you won't need to manage this membership information in your app. Your customers will also be happy as they would only need to manage this in one place. 

####1. Register Auth0 with Google
Use Google's API console for this. See [here](goog-clientid) for full instructions. 

####2. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
Copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` generated by Google on your connection settings. 

####3. Edit the callback URL
Make sure the callback address in Google is configured to

        https://@@account.namespace@@/login/callback

### Office 365
Office 365 uses [WS-Federation](http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsfed/federation/v1.2/os/ws-federation-1.2-spec-os.html) and SAML tokens. Auth0 will handle the protocol transition between your app (that continues to use OAuth2) and O365.

####1. Register Auth0 with Office365
You need to use Microsoft's [Seller Dashboard](https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com). See [here](o365-clientid) for full instructions. 

####2. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
Once you get a `clientId` and `clientSecret` enter them into the connection's settings.

> Why does Office365 need a `clientId` and `clientSecret` if it uses WS-Federation? Because querying Windows Azure Active Directory uses OAuth authentication.

### Active Directory Federation Services
ADFS is frequently used in companies that have deployed Active Directory. To add a an ADFS connection you just need the enter the public address of the ADFS server. 

![](img/adfs-connection.png)

Auth0 will automatically download the __WS-FederationMetadata__ from the endpoint:

	https://{YOUR ADFS SERVER}/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml

And import all configuration from there.

Auth0 will also generate a PowerShell script to automate the configuration of the ADFS server to recognize Auth0 as a __Relying Party__, and to issue a standard set of claims:

|Claim                            					                 | Description 		   |
|====================================================================|=====================|
|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress  | e-mail    		   | 
|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name          | User's name 		   |
|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier| A unique identifier |
|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname     | Given name    	   |
|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname       | User's lastname 	   |

>Even though this connection is named "ADFS", it would actually work with any WS-Federation compliant server. The PowerShell is ADFS specific though.

##Social Identity Providers

###Google OpenID
Configuring Google OpenID is the simplest, becuase...well, there's no configuration!

Once you add a Google OpenId connection, you are ready to go. The authentication flow is pretty straight forward:

1. A user initiates login in the app
2. User is redirected to Auth0 
3. User is immediately redirected to Google for authentication 
4. User enters username and password 
5. User consents to disclosing information (name, e-mail) to Auth0
6. A postback happens against the app callback URL
7. Done!

> There's no user interaction between steps 2 and 3 . Steps 4 and 5 are specific to Google and might not happen necessarily if the process is repeated (e.g. the user selects 'remember me' in Google)

The biggest disadvantage is that you only get a very basic profile from the user: names (in various forms and segments: name, last name, given name, etc.), and an e-mail.

### Google OAuth2
This identity provider allows you to get much more information about the user, but you need to register Auth0 with Google. 

####1. Register Auth0 with Google
Use Google's API console for this. See [here](goog-clientid) for full instructions. 

####2. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
Copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` generated by Google on your connection settings. 

####3. Edit the callback URL
Make sure the callback address in Google is configured to

        https://@@account.namespace@@/login/callback

---

###Microsoft Accounts
This one is very similar to Google OAuth.

####1. Register Auth0 with Microsoft
Use the Live Connect Developer Center. See [here](ms-account-clientid) for full instructions. 

####2. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
Copy the `clientId` and `clientSecret` generated by Microsoft on your connection settings. 

####3. Edit the callback URL
Make sure the callback address in Microsoft Account is configured to

        https://@@account.namespace@@/login/callback
