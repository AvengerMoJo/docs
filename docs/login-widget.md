# Login Widget

Auth0 Login Widget makes it easy to integrate login in your your app so you don't have to worry about:

* Having a good looking login dialog that looks good on any resolution and device
* Finding icons for the social providers
* Remembering what was the identity provider the user has chosen last time
* Solving the home realm discovery issue with enterprise users (i.e.: ask the enterprise user the email and redirect to the right enterprise identity provider)
* Implementing the sign in protocol
