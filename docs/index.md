# Getting started with Auth0

## First things first

[@IF!(Authenticated)]
The very first thing you will need to run any of these tutorials is to create an account with Auth0. You haven't done so yet. Go [here](http://app.auth0.com) and create a new account. It will take 3 minutes.

If you are not ready for that, that's ok. You can still explore our documentation but you might not be able to see everything in action.
[@ELSE]

Welcome [@Username]! You are ready to test drive Auth0. All tutorials have been tailored to your account. So in most cases, all you need to do is copy the code snippets and paste them into your projects.

The introductory tutorials will take a just a few minutes to complete. And the good news is that most scenarios need just these! A lot of the underlying mechanics of identity management are hidden so you don't need to deal with them.
[@END]

We have tutorials for all the popular platforms:

- [Node.js](a0-nodejs-tutorial)
- [iOS](a0-ios-tutorial)
- [Android](a0-android-tutorial)
- [Windows Store Apps (Windows 8 RT)](a0-win8-tutorial)
- [ASP.NET MVC](a0-mvc-tutorial)
- [ASP.NET WebForms](a0-webforms-tutorial)
- [SharePoint 2010](a0-sp2010-tutorial)
- [SharePoint 2013](a0-sp2013-tutorial)

We suggest you should start with any of the above first. That should give you a good idea of how Auth0 works. After that, you can read more about more advanced concepts:

- [Supported Identity Providers](a0-identityproviders)
- [Connecting with different identity providers](a0-connecting-with-idp)
- [Using the Auth0 API](a0-api-reference)
