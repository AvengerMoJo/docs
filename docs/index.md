# Getting started with Auth0

### First things first

Hello @@account.userName@@! Ready to test drive Auth0? All tutorials have been tailored to your account. So in most cases, all you need to do is copy the code snippets and paste them into your projects and tools.

The introductory tutorials will take a just a few minutes to complete. And the good news is that most scenarios need just these! A lot of the underlying mechanics of identity management are hidden so you don't need to deal with them.

We have tutorials for all the popular platforms:

- [Node.js](nodejs-tutorial) / [ASP.NET MVC](aspnet-tutorial) / [ASP.NET Owin](aspnet-owin-tutorial) / [Ruby](rails-tutorial) / [PHP](php-tutorial) / [Java](java-tutorial)
- [iOS](ios-tutorial) / [Android](android-tutorial) / [Windows Phone](windowsphone-tutorial) / [Xamarin](xamarin-tutorial)
- Windows Store Apps: [Windows 8 - JavaScript](win8-tutorial) / [Windows 8 - C#](win8-cs-tutorial)
- [ASP.NET Web API](aspnetwebapi-tutorial) / [ServiceStack](servicestack-tutorial)

We suggest you should start with any of the above first. That should give you a good idea of how Auth0 works. After that, you can read more about more advanced concepts:

- [Supported Identity Providers](identityproviders)
- [Standard-based Protocols](protocols)
